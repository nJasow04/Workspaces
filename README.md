# Workspaces
This is a project I made over roughly a 3 day period. Its purpose to serve as simple, light weight, tab manager chrome extension.

## Problem
The main problem with not closing my tabs is that my desktop gets super disorganized, which is a hugely discomforting feeling and seeing as chrome devours my computer's RAM I find my hardware to become a lot slower.

## Solution
This is a chrome web extension to solve all your problems. It's extremely simple to use, lightweight, secure, simply pin the extension, click save workspace to save all tabs in the current, click view workspaces to see all your saved workspaces, and then to reopen a workspace, simply click the play button at the top right of the workspace. If you no longer need a workspace, simply click the x button. But if you didn't mean to do it, its ok, go to the recently deleted tab to see the last four of your most recently deleted workspaces.
