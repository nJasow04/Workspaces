# Workspaces

## Overview
This was a project I made in rouhgly 3 days. Its basically a very simple, easy to use tab manager. Basically, I have a lot of unfinished projects, and these prroject
typically come with a lot of unclosed windows of videos I need to watch later, or pdfs I need to read over, etc, but I don't want to close them because, 1. I wouldn't
be able to remember all of the tabs, and 2. even if I could remember them, I reopening them would be a huge hastle.

## Problem
The main problem with not closing my tabs is that my desktop gets super disorganized, which is a hugely discomforting feeling and seeing as chrome devours my computer's
RAM I find my hardware to become a lot slower.

## Solution
This is a chrome web extension to solve all your problems. It's extremely simple to use, lightweight, secure, simply pin the extension, click save workspace to save all 
tabs in the current, click view workspaces to see all your saved workspaces, and then to reopen a workspace, simply click the play button at the top right of the 
workspace. If you no longer need a workspace, simply click the x button. But if you didn't mean to do it, its ok, go to the recently deleted tab to see the last four 
of your most recently deleted workspaces. 

## Thank You
If you downloaded this extension, thank you! I hope you enjoy my work, please contact me if you find any bugs.
